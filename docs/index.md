### Big Data in Action
- The [Data in Action Toolkit](https://worldbank.github.io/Data-in-Action) page houses a collection of materials to support the process of designing and delivering data products in the context of international development. 
- The [Big Data in Action for Development series](https://olc.worldbank.org/content/big-data-action-development), is a 3-part learning series hosted on the World Bank's Open Learning Campus platform. The series features bite-sized learning modules comprising of case studies and expert interviews on how non-traditional data can be used to inform decision-making, enhance service delivery, and promote citizen engagement for improved outcomes in international development.

### Tools and Tutorials
- The [Python for Data Science](https://github.com/worldbank/Python-for-Data-Science) course repo contains learning materials on basic to intermediate python, as well as introductory material on topics including: [machine learning, use of APIs, geospatial analysis](https://github.com/worldbank/Python-for-Data-Science/tree/master/July_2019_Poverty_GP/day_3), [text analysis (natural language processing), and use of call detail records (CDR) in development](https://github.com/worldbank/Python-for-Data-Science/tree/master/July_2019_Poverty_GP/day_4). 
- [Intro to git / GitHub](https://osf.io/e54gy/): training materials for reusable and collaborative workflows from our colleagues at DIME.
- The [Open Night Lights Tutorial](https://worldbank.github.io/OpenNightLights/welcome.html) showcases the power of remote sensing data and provides guidance on the tools to work with these data.
